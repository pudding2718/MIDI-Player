- **New**: Start a new composition. *(Shortcut: âŒ˜N)*
- **Open**: Open an existing composition. *(Shortcut: âŒ˜O)*
- **Exit**: Close the application. *(Shortcut: âŒ˜E)*

### Edit Menu
- **Undo/Redo**: Revert or reapply the last action. *(Shortcuts: âŒ˜Z / â‡§âŒ˜Z)*
- **Select All**: Select all notes in the composition. *(Shortcut: âŒ˜A)*
- **Change Instrument**: Switch between different instruments for selected notes. *(Shortcut: âŒ˜T)*

- **Composition and Playback**: Add, edit, group, and play notes with real-time feedback.
- **Instrument Variety**: Choose from multiple instruments like Piano, Violin, and Guitar.
- **Visual and Interactive UI**: Utilize JavaFX for a polished user experience.
- **File Management**: Save and reload compositions as `.composer` files.
- **Advanced Utilities**: Leverage JSON serialization, undo/redo history, and custom MIDI event handling.


## How to Use

1. **Add Notes**: Click on the composition pane to place notes.
2. **Group and Edit**: Drag, group, and modify notes with ease.
3. **Change Instruments**: Use the instrument panel to select desired sounds.
4. **Playback**: Press play to hear your composition with animated feedback.
5. **Save and Load**: Save your work as `.composer` files and reload them anytime.


## Tech Stack

- **JavaFX**: For the graphical interface.
- **Maven**: Dependency and build management.
- **Gson**: JSON operations.
- **MIDI Library**: Custom `MidiPlayer` built with `javax.sound.midi`.

## Project Structure

### Core Components

- **`MainApplication`**: The entry point of the application, initializing the JavaFX stage.
- **`MidiPlayer`**: Manages MIDI sequences, adding events, and playback.

### Controllers and Interfaces

- **`Controllers`**:
  - `MainController`, `MenuController`, and `InstrumentsController` handle user interactions and business logic.
- **`Interfaces`**:
  - `INote`, `IComposable`, `IHideable`, and `ISelectable` define core functionality for musical notes and objects.

### Helpers

Utility classes for extended functionality:
- **`FileHelper`**: File operations for `.composer` files.
- **`JsonHelper`**: JSON serialization/deserialization for complex note objects.
- **`NoteHelper`**: Handles note creation, selection, and grouping.
- **`OperationHistoryHelper`**: Tracks undo/redo actions.

### Resources

- **FXML Files**: Define the UI layout for `Main.fxml`, `Menu.fxml`, and `Instruments.fxml`.
- **Module Configuration**: Managed in `module-info.java`.
- **Maven Configuration**: Dependencies and build setup in `pom.xml`.
